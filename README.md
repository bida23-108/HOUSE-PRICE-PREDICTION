# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models, focusing on both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**. The goal is to build, evaluate, and deploy a predictive system that provides reliable estimates of housing prices based on various input features.

## Contents

- `data/` – Contains the cleaned dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/` – Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
- `scripts/` – Modular Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `visuals/` – Performance graphs and visualizations of the model outputs.
- `presentation/` – PowerPoint slides for project demonstration.
- `report/` – Project documentation and final evaluation.
- `README.md` – This file.

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

The final trained model (saved as `.pkl`) is **not uploaded here** due to file size restrictions on Teams. However, it is available upon request.
