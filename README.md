# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models, focusing on both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**. The goal is to build, evaluate, and deploy a predictive system that provides reliable estimates of housing prices based on various input features.

## Contents

- `feature_importances.png` – Random Forest feature importance chart.
- `geo_price_distribution.png` – Price distribution mapped geographically.
- `income_vs_price.png` – Relationship between income and house price.
- `rooms_perh_median.png` – Distribution of rooms per household vs median price.
- `scaler.pkl` – Serialized Scikit-learn scaler used for preprocessing.
- `README.md` – This file.
- `MARKET TRENDS AND MACHINE LEARNING PP.pptx` - PowerPoint slides for the project.
- `R_I_final_document.pdf` - Project documentation and final evaluation.


## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

The best random forest model (saved as `.pkl`) is **not uploaded here** due to file size restrictions on Github. However, it is available upon request.

##  Notes

- Built using Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Includes an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
- Evaluation metrics: **MAE**, **RMSE**, **R² Score**.
